/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello World!");

console.log('Hello World!')

console.log(22)

console.log(2+2)

console.log("Hello World!\nHave a Wonderful Day!")

console.log("Hello World!","Nice to Meet You!")

console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"')
/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.

   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? ---- Code causes a Syntax Error

   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
      Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? ---- YES, BOTH Opening & Closing Quote marks are NEEDED!!!
      Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? ---- There is NO difference between using Single or Double quote, BUT must be consistent and Open & Close with the same quote.

   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. ---- The code still works!!!

   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together). ---- Use operators "+, -, /, *"

   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.  ---- Add "\n" in the string to create a Line BReak

   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". ---- Utilize the OTHER quote either Single or Double encasing the message
   9. Other. You choose!
